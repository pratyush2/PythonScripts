There are three types of quoatations.

' single 
'' double
''' tripple

All these are used to assign strings to a variable.
However if string is very short length then we can go with eiter single or double

Now for long lenght i mena more than one line then we can go with tripple quotations.

we can aslo use single and double but with escape charcter \n

ex:

x='''This is first line
This is second line
This is third line'''


x="This is first line \nThis is second line\nThis is third line"
