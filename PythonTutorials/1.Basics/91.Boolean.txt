In boolean data type we are having only two values

True and False  

x=True then print type(x)
but if you right x="True" and then print type(x) it will give type as string because we quoted that data.By deafult any data which is der in quotes is always a string. Remember that.


Observe the following:

print bool(23)   print bool(-234) print bool(1) print bool(" ")
print bool(0) print bool("") 

so always non-zero or non-empty value will give resultant as boolean True
remaing False means zero and empty values.
