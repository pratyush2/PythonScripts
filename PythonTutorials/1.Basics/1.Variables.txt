Variable are simply used to store a value.We can store any value/datatype into a variable.
I mean value/data means it could be a number(int,float,complex),string,Boolean,list,tuple,dictionay and sets


Storing numbers into a variable:
x=3
y=4.56
z=0.345

stroing strings/characters into a variable:
my_name="Narendra"
x='P'

x,y=4,5
x=6;y=56


Note: We will cover remaining concepts later..
