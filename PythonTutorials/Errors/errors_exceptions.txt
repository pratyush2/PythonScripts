It is very common to encounter errors during the execution of a program. Two common kinds of errors that you may have to deal with 
are syntax errors and exceptions. Syntax errors occur when you type the code incorrectly. In such cases, the error  (erroneous) line is 
repeated by the parser with an arrow pointing to the earliest location where the error was detected.

Exceptions are different from syntax errors. They occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens.
For example: let's say you are asking the user to input a number in order to perform a division. Now,if the user enters a number 0 instead
of non-zero value and you ryt to divide non-zero number with a zero number by the given input then the program will give output a 
ZeroDivisionError

ex: 4/0
Let me take one more example:
if you print some variable without defining a value then it will give NameError.

Let me take one more example:

suppose if you try to divide or add number with string then you will get TypeError.

ex: 4+"hi"

Let me take one more example:
suppose you are having a li =[3,4,5]
then if you try to print li[3] then you will get an IndexError.

=========================================
Let me take one more example:
suppose if you trying to read an integer with
x=int(raw_input("Enter any number: "))

then you will get ValueError.
=========================================


Let me take one more example:
if you try to read a file which not existing then you will get IOError. This is also call file error.



one more exception:
suppose you are trying to import a module but which is not been there with python then you will get ImportError.




When you are not properly handling exceptions, the program will abruptly quit as it won't know what to do in such cases.
