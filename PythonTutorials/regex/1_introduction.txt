Suppose if my_string="Python is easy and it has a powerful modules"

Now let me split this:

print my_string.split()  So, it will split with default spliting character that is space.

Instead of space: let me take spliting character is: "is"
print my_string.split('is')  So, it will split your my_string wherever 'is'word is there.

But i want to split my_string such that wherever either is or it are there, there i want to split my string. Then how ?
So,it is not possible with normal spliting character concept. Anyway to split your stirng operation is my_string.split() only.
but that spliting character is now two words they are "is" and "it".
split() operation will take only one string character to split your string. Then how can we achieve our requirement.

suppose if i form  a spliting string character such that , that string represents two words then our work is over right?

Forming a single string such that that represents more than one charter/string is called regular expression. or pattern.

A regular expression (or "regex") is a search pattern/string used for matching one or more characters within a string.

Python has a in-built module to work with regex. That is re module.

Now let me complete our taks with the re module.
import re

print re.split("i[st],my_string)

Here, re.split("i[st]",my_string) is called regular expression and i[st] is called pattern.

So, if you want to good at regular expression then you must know how to form a pattern for our requirement.

Once if you are good at how to make patterns then you shold know different operations of re module.


There different operations in re module are:

re.match re.search re.findall re.findaiter, re.complie,re.split re.sub
